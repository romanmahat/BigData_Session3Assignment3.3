Explain the following concept.


       DDL(Data Definition Language) :
                        Data Definition Language actually consists of the hive commands that can be used to define the database 
                        schema. It simply deals with descriptions of the database schema and is used to create and modify the structure
                        of database objects in database. The following are DDL commands in hive.
                                                       
                                                        a)CREATE
                                                        b)DROP
                                                        c)ALTER
                                                        d)RENAME
                                                        
                                                        
                          DML(Data Manipulation Language): 
                          The HIVE commands that deals with the manipulation of data present in database belong to DML or Data Manipulation
                          Language and this includes most of the HIVE statements.for example
                          
                                                     a)load data
                                                     b)select 
                                                     c)group by
                                                     d)sort by
                                                     e)order by
                                                     
                           HIVEQL Manupulation:
                                          It is a hive command which is use for optimizzation of hive table speacially
                                           it is use when we want optimization.for example
                                           
                                                    a) partition by
                                                    b)clustered by etc..
